## statistics-calculator
Project created during the 2nd Semester of Computer Engineering, in the PIEF discipline (FACAMP Engineering Integration Project) II. Our client would like to obtain a statistical calculator that could calculate the mean, mode, median, quartile, variance, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, data classification of a series of values and that at the end would also show a graph of the frequencies of these values. Check out the figures below:
